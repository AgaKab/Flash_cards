Project inspired by the Pomodoro technique, which allows you to effectively manage work/study time and duties.

The user interface of the program was created with a Canvas widget that provides graphical tools for Tkinter.
In order to avoid errors, exception handling (try/except/else method) has been implemented in the code.
